## The stuff below are to get mgmt to build. It fails otherwise.
# Pinning prometheus to master/HEAD on 20170227, as etcd has pinned it 0.8.0, which mgmt does not work with.
# XXX: Is this really required for libmgmt to work? GD2 just requires the engine, not anything else.
# If libmgmt could not depend on this, we'll be good.
